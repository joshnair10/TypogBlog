This goes without saying: The NBA is the most popular and the most watched basketball league in the world. 30 teams from all over America battle it out in an 82 game regular season to qualify for the play-offs, for which the finals attracted 7.5m viewers in the USA alone. The logo was designed decades ago, in 1969, with the iconic silhouette being an outline of then NBA player Jerry West of the Los Angeles Lakers.
