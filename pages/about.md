Hello and welcome to The Typog Blog! I'm Joshua Nair and I study Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University. I will be posting blog articles that analyse sports logos, focusing on the effectiveness of typography and how much of a difference it can make to have good typography in a logo among other things, such as colours and shapes. 

My blog will very much be centered around sports, as I feel logos have such a big part to play in advertising and bringing attention to a certain team/competition/league, especially to newcomers in a sport. I will be sharing on my views on these logos and explaining why the logos and typography used will either benefit or limit the organisation behind it.

The logo I have used makes it clear to people that this is a sports-focused blog, and the banner I have chosen shows how effective typography can be created by people, in this situation, during a football match.
